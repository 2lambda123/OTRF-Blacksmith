# Blacksmith

The Blacksmit project focuses on providing dynamic easy-to-use templates for security researches to model and provision resources needed to automatically deploy applications in the cloud. It currently leverages [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to model infrastructure and architecture of applications in AWS.

# Goals

* Expedite research by providing dynamic templates to deploy applications in the cloud.
* Translate favorite applications or tools into cloud templates for developing and testing.
* Replicate research environments for training purposes
* Learn more about AWS CloudFormation
